# revivify-code
  <p>So for this project my goal is to update and improve existing code while maintaining the current layout.</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
  <p>First im going to start at the top by updating the title of the page.</p>
  
<h2>Step 2</h2>
  <p>Next im going to identify any obtuse html tags and give it an update.</p>
  
<h2>Step 3</h2>
  <p>I'm going to identify any images that need to be updated with alt tags</p>
  
<h2>Step 4</h2>
  <p>I noticed a lot of unnecessary CSS and condensed them and I noticed i missed some HTML tags that could be changed so I fixed them.</p> 
  
<h2>Step 5</h2>
  <p>Now I'm going to hand over to someone for some peer review</p>
