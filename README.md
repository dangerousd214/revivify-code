# revivify-code
  <p>So for this project my goal is to update and improve existing code while maintaining the current layout.</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
  <p>First im going to start at the top by updating the title of the page. The current title is just website so thats no good.</p>
  
<h2>Step 2</h2>
  <p>Next im going to identify any obtuse html tags and give it an update. So we have a lot of div tags with id and class selectors in them. However after taking a look at style page there isn't any styling linked to I'd tags so I'm removing them and most of the class tags are labeled as main or header. So I'm just going to change those to the semantic html tags with similar names aswell as change the css counter part.</p>
  
<h2>Step 3</h2>
  <p>I'm going to identify any images that need to be updated with alt tags. Which happens to be all of them none of them had alt tags so its been fixed</p>
  
<h2>Step 4</h2>
  <p>I noticed a lot of unnecessary CSS and condensed them and I noticed i missed some HTML tags that could be changed so I fixed them. There were several instances in the style sheet that had the same attribute for all photos so I combined them into one. I also found a class selector with nothing attached on html side so it was removed.</p> 
  
<h2>Step 5</h2>
  <p>Now I'm going to hand it over to someone for some peer review</p>
  
<h2>Step 6</h2>
  <p>After I had someone look over they noticed the h tags for footer wasnt correct and some of the css could be rearranged to follow the html better. So I went and moved it around and fixed h tag now its time to submit.
